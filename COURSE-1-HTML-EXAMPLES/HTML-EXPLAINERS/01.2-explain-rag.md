# Understanding RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

**RAG** stands for **Retrieval Augmented Generation**. It's a technique that enhances AI responses by providing the model with relevant external information that wasn't part of its original training data.

## How It Works

Instead of relying solely on the AI's pre-trained knowledge, RAG follows this pattern:

1. **Retrieve** relevant information from external sources (databases, documents, APIs, etc.)
2. **Augment** the AI prompt by adding this retrieved information as context
3. **Generate** a response based on both the AI's knowledge AND the provided context

## RAG in This File

In your HTML file, RAG is implemented in a simple but effective way:

```javascript
RAG = `
   Brighton Web Development Meet Up is taking place on October 29th.
   The venue is the Skiff.
   The event starts at 6:30 PM and finishes at 9:00 PM.
   ...
`

system_prompt += RAG;
```

Here's what's happening:

1. **The Context**: Specific information about the Brighton Web Development meetup is stored in the `RAG` variable - details like dates, venue, organizer, and history.

2. **The Augmentation**: This information is appended to the system prompt before sending it to OpenAI's API.

3. **The Result**: When a user asks "When was the first meetup held?", the AI can accurately answer "1865 (3rd October 1865)" because that information was provided in the context, even though it's not part of GPT's training data.

## Why This Is Useful

Without RAG, if you asked GPT about this specific Brighton meetup, it wouldn't know the details. But by injecting this information into the prompt, you can:

- Provide up-to-date information that's newer than the model's training cutoff
- Add proprietary or private data that the model was never trained on
- Ensure accurate, specific answers about niche topics
- Create AI applications that work with your own databases and content

The comment in your code mentions that this can be "dynamic content retrieved from a database or API" - meaning in a production system, you'd typically fetch this information programmatically rather than hardcoding it.
