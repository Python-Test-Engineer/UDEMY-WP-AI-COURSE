# Creation

Using WordPress create a one page plugin that has the following:

A section to add OpenAI API key via an input field with a show/hide icon to reveal it. Do not use emojis.

Use PHP only NO JS. Use comments fully to help understanding.

A section that has a text box field to enter a query and and output area that shows the result of an API request to OpenAI.

Using PHP only, create a very basic AI Agent that sends a request to OpenAI using the default"gpt-4o-mini" model and gets a response - extract the content from the message and display in an output area.

Add ChatGPT style dark mode styling.
