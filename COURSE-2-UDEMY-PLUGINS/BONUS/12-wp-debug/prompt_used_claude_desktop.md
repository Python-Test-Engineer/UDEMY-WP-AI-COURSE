Create a simple one page WP plugin that illustrates debugging for an OpenAI agent request in JavaSript.
As it progresses, it does console.log but also keeps a list of all these console.loogs and offers a dialog box at end to download a list of these console.logs in markdownd file.
The aim is to demonstrate a good logging technique rather than the AI fetures. Simply letting a user ask a question and get a response is sufficient. 
Also output this debug log in an area on the page.
Have an iput field for the OPENA_API_KEY to be set
