## ROUND 1

I have a working file 20-capstone\prompt9\rag_chatgpt_ui_plugin_with_permalinks_and_memory.php

Change plugin to have memory so that I can ask a follow up question on the answer received

Create unique names as the existing plugin will be active

## ROUND 2

20-capstone\prompt9\20.3-CAPSTONE\rag_chatgpt_ui_with_memory.php - when using the RAG CONTEXT USED do not truncate but display all the context used and also with the citations present the permalink with post title  rather than id
